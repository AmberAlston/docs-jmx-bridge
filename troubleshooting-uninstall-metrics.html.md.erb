<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

The JMX Bridge tool (formerly Ops Metrics) is a JMX extension for Elastic Runtime. JMX Bridge collects and exposes system data from Cloud Foundry components via a JMX endpoint.
Use this system data to monitor your installation and assist in troubleshooting.

The JMX Bridge tool is composed of three virtual machines:

- The JMX Provider
- A VM that governs compilation
- A nozzle for the [Loggregator Firehose](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/loggregator/architecture.html)

To deploy JMX Bridge, see the [Deploying JMX Bridge](./deploy-metrics.html) topic.
